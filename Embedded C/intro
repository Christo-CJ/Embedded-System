Features of c language can be used in Embedded C 
and also has some additional features.
  
what is embedded C?
features of c language plus additional features of hardware communication.
Embedded c is an extention to C programming language designed for microcontroller software development.

Few feature of c language will not work in embedded c 

1.File handling will not work(NO OS is the reason)
2.Command line argument will not work (no OS) 
3.Avoid recursion (limited memory)
4.Avoid DMA(limited memory)
 


Embedded c                             v/s                             C language
----------                                                             ----------
1.Embedded C is designed for microcontroleer software development     1.It is designed for computer software development
2.OS environment is not required to execuet emb-c code                2.OS environment is mandatory to execute C language
3.Direct hardware communication is possible through registers         3.Direct hardware communication not possible
4.We can use all microcontrollers SFRs in the embedded C              4.We cannot use any type of registers
   note we cannot use GPR i emb c
5.Cross compiler is used to compile embedded c code                   5.Native compiler is used to compile c language
6.We can directly communicate with RAM address                        6.C language not allow to communicate with RAM



How to define SFR in ARMCC compiler
syntax: #define REG_NAME((volatile unsigned int*)*REG_ADDR)

LPC2129
#define T0PR((*(volatile unsigned int*)0xE00400C))



AMBA
----
Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture
AMBA is used to connect peripherals
AMBA bus is used to interface all the on-chip peripherals of ARM controller to a ARM procesor

There are two types of AMBA bus used inLPC2129
1.Advanced High performance Bus(AHB)
2.Advanced Peripgeral Bus(APB)


Advanced High Performance Bus
------------------------------
It is high bandwidth bus used to connect high speed peripherals of ARM SOC to ARM processor
eg: VIC Vectored Interupt controller


Advanced Peripheral Bus
-----------------------
It is low bandwidth bus used to connect slow speed peripheral of ARM SoC to ARM processor
eg:GPIO,UART,ADC,Timer<I2C,SPI...

low bandwidth bus used to connect slow speed peripheral slot 
ARMSoC to ARM processor
eg:GPIO,UART,SPI,I2C..

PCLK depends upon VPB divideer(VLSI peripheral bus divider)
VPBDiv can control PCLK.


VPBDiv register configuration
-----------------------------
if VPBDiv ==0               //default value is 0
PCLK=CCLK/4=60/4=15MHz (default)

Every APB peripheral will get 15 MHz for use
Individual peripheral baud rate need to be programmed .The peripheral and external device nust have same baud rate.
if we change the VPBDiv Reg value;PCLK value also change
By default value of VPBDiv register in LPC2129 is 0
ie,every peripheral will get 15MHz for internal use
  every peripheral which are connected on APB Bus is 15MHz

UART is a peripheral which wil communicate  and connect with bluetooth modem
freq of bluetooth modem=9600Hz
freq os UART peripheral =15MHz
15MHz/2=9600Hz

 we need to set the same freq of bluetooth modem and uart then only we can exhchange data b/w uart and bluetooth modem.
 local bus is not AMBA bus 
 AHB and APB for AMBA bus


 VPBDiv value                          PCLK
 ------------                          ----
 0                              pclk=cclk/4=60/4=15MHz
 1                                          60/1=60MHz
 2                                          60/2=30MHz
 3                                      reserved
 4                                          60/4=15MHz
 5                                          60/1=60MHz
 6                                          60/2=30MHz
 7                                      reserved
 8                                          60/4=15MHz

 When we change the controller ;CCLK and PCLK will change 
 if the cclk changed;Then pclk will automatically change
