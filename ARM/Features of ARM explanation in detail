the registers inside the ARM are all 32 bit registers. 
ARM works on a 3.3 v and working frequency is 60 MHz
If processor is 32 bit ALU processing capacity is 32 bit  

8 bit processor can do 16 bit operation but it will take 2 cycles 
8 bit can do 32 bit but takes 4 cycle

if processor is 32 bit means ALU processing capacity is 32 bit  
if processor is 32 bit size of register is also 32 bit


memory split ration since using Von-Neumann arch is 3:1
3GB:1GB
Data memory:program memory

program memory:what programs written all stored there
Data memory   :Runtime data stored in data memory along with it special function register(SFR) all are available in the RAM


what/why is Pipe line architecture?
It boost execution speed of processor while other instructions are being fetched and decoded.

37 different register
Types of Registers:
 * General purpose register
 * Special function Registers(SFR)

SFR are used for hardware communication
GPR storing Runtime data and address
SFR are present outside processor.They are at RAM

ARM
* old version ARM7 arch:armv3
* new version ARM7 arch:armv4T

That the architecture is different that whether it supports the different instruction sets instruction sets are different in different architecture.

* ARM instruction set is default instruction set
  All ARM procssors can understand ARM instructions
* THUMB instructions is set is optimal
  every instrcution cannot be understandable only few can understand thumb instructions.

ARMV4T T stands for Thumb

suppose we write using thumb old version cannot understand whether it is thumb or not.

ARM has embedded In Circuit Emulator
is used for debug the software of embedded system

in normal controller we cannot execute step by step
ICE will allow embedded software code step by step
In PC we execute one line execution Every line we can monitor it on the hardware.

User mode is the only non previleged mode all other modes are privileged modes
