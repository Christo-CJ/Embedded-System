FIQ mode processor gets more number of registers
Any local variable declared in fiq it will not go to stack it will be having special register
FIQ executes faster
In user mode there is no SPSR register
IN every processor stack pointer (SP) and program counter(PC)

Why no SPSR in usr/sys mode?
To restyoring previous content SPSR used
depends on the interupted its in main usr mode thats why no spsr required
But if interupted and carrying from any other mode such as IRQ,FIQ other modes have the spsr to have the context of the mode
USR mode from it is jumping So since it s in USR/sys mode no need to save spsr.
