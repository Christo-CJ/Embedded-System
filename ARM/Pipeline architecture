Pipeline Architecture
---------------------
ICE In Circuit Emulator (used fr hardware debug)
IDU Instruction Decoding Unit
ALU Arithmetic logic unit

Role of CORE
.Execute Instructions sequentially
.Fetching
.Decoding

One core execute one instruction at a time
If two core two instructions can be executed.

To execute instructions processor takes 3 clock cycles

3 stages: Fetch,Decode,Execute(all process happens in core only)

Instructions are parallely done
If one Instruction is decoding one another instruction will be fetched.

like the clk cycle it will be fetched decoded and executed


.Faster execution
without pipeline it would take clk cycles to process each instructions but in pipeline arch core is executing instruction processor will be doing other activities parallely.

when decoder comes '0' it will understand no instruction but it will not stop.It will go till last memory check whether there is instruction in any location.
here with pipeline only take 8 clk cycle
but without pipeline it take 21 cycles

In one clk cycle itself that the execution is done but processor will be doing parallely other instructions fetching and decoding.
