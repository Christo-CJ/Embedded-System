Features of LPC2129
--------------------
1. ARM7TDMI-S basedhigh performance 32 bit RISC microcontroller with THUMB extensions

  ARM7-family version
  T   -Thumb Instructions
  D   -hardware Debugger
  M   -Multiplier and accummulator unit
  I   -fast Interupts
  S   -Synthesis     process of converting programming description into network of logic gates is called synthesis

2. 256KB ownchip Flash ROM within sysytem programming(ISP) and IN Application Programming(IAP)
   ISP: that for dumbing hex files there is no need to remove microcontroller from target board and do the firmware(microcontroller programing) 
        so now aa days programs can be done on the target board itself withour removing microcontroller from target.

   IAP: processor can write into flash memory 
         if directly allowed processor can write programmer may delete he code causing problems

3. 16KB RAM
4. Vectored Interupts Controller(VIC) with configurable priorites and vector addresses
5. Two UART(UART0 and UART1)
6. I2C serial Interface
7.2 SPI serial Interfcae(SPI0 and SPI1)
8. Two timers(7 capture/compare channels(timer0 and timer1))
9. PWM unit with upto 6PWM outputs

5. Two UART
    .for seriall communication its used
    .one of the oldest protocol companies used for serial communication.
    .one easy method for comunication
    eg: biometric sensor project,RFID,GPS models
    .Hardware connection is simple

6. I2C Inter integrated circuit
   I2c inbuild also called I2C peripheral we can communicate with external display,emory chip...
    eg:pressure sensor
