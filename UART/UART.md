# Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter  

This is a very old protocol.   
Exchange data with computer and external UART devices. 

What is protocol?   
Set of standards.  

What is UART?  
The UART is on-chip peripheral of microcontroller.UART is serial in parallel out and parallel in serial out peripheral.   

*Note*:While transmitting data UART act as parallel in serial out while receiving data uart act as serial in parallel out peripheral.   

Why UART is used in Embedded system?  
UART is designed for Asynchronous Serial Communication.

`Serial Communication` is a process of sending one bit at a time   
`parallel communication` is a process of sending multiple bits ata time .parallel increases hardware size and increases cost.Now a days all companies are moving towards serial communication.   

`Serial communication light weight communication`
